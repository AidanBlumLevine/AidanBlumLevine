Hi!

Here's some of the projects I've done that are worth checking out:

  Block based raymarched fractal builder and explorer 
- https://aidanblumlevine.github.io/satellitemaps/
  GAN trained to create street maps from satellite maps
- https://aidanblumlevine.github.io/rectangles/
  Procedurally generated rectangle shapes
- https://quantum-chesss.herokuapp.com  
  Two player chess modification where both players move at the same time (still working on adding a tutorial)
